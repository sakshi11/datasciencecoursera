When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you
| do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.

Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or
'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
Type 'q()' to quit R.

If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related to R, you
| can type help.start() at the prompt, which will open a menu of resources (either
| within RStudio or your default web browser, depending on your setup). Alternatively, a
| simple web search often yields the answer you're looking for.

To open a more complete description of the dataset in a separate
| text file, type viewinfo() when you are back at the prompt (>).

plot(x= ,y= ,xlab= ,ylab= ,main= , sub= ,...)

col=2 - red color

xlim = c(10, 15) - limit x axis

Plot cars using triangles.  (Use pch = 2 

The plot help page (?plot) only covers a small number of the many arguments that can
| be passed in to plot() and to other graphical functions. To begin to explore the many
| other options, look at ?par. Let's look at some of the more commonly used ones.

You can also change the shape of the symbols in the plot. The help page for points
| (?points) provides the details

Arguments like "col" and "pch" may not seem very intuitive. And that is because they
| aren't! So, many/most people use more modern packages, like ggplot2, for creating
| their graphics in R.

another package- lattice

Type data(mtcars) to load the data.

Instead of adding data columns directly as input arguments, as we did with plot(), it
| is often handy to pass in the entire data frame. This is what the "data" argument in
| boxplot() allows.

boxplot(), like many R functions, also takes a "formula" argument, generally an
| expression with a tilde ("~") which indicates the relationship between the input
| variables. This allows you to enter something like mpg ~ cyl to plot the relationship
| between cyl (number of cylinders) on the x-axis and mpg (miles per gallon) on the
| y-axis.



When looking at a single variable, histograms are a useful tool. hist() is the
| associated R function. Like plot(), hist() is best used by just passing in a single
| vector.
